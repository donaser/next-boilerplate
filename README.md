# Donaser Boilerplate

The Boilerplate already included typescript by default, TailwindCSS, Eslint, Prettier, Husky, lint Staged and Commitizen.

### install Commitizen as Globally

`npm install -g commitizen`
<br />
<br />
then initialize project with
<br />

`commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact`

<br />
if you are using yarn

<br />

`commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --yarn --dev --exact`.

 <br />

Dont do manual commit like `git commit -m "Add feature C"` its disgusting!.
just `git cz` and following the instruction until finish.
